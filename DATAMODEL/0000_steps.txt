Main steps:

1. Check that everything is loaded correctly
2. Copy photos over
3. Check suspensions (from notes)
4. Check supply (from notes)
6. Process
    - Check VRMs (or count values)
    - Calculate demand/stress
7. Output



 - output supply
 - copy photos and rename

-- For VRMs
* use scripts in 1000s

1. verify completeness of all beats
2. standardise VRM formats
3. remove duplicates and blanks
4. use "fuzzy" match
5. check "non-standard" VRMs
6. calculate demand
7. output VRMs and RiS

-- For Counts
* use scripts in 2000s

1. verify completeness of all beats
2. calculate demand
3. output Counts and RiS

--- Within spreadsheets, deal with:
 - Suspensions (ensure consistency across beats)
 - VRMs (check for consistency)

-- Reimport into

VRMs_Final
RestrictionsInSurveys_Final

Any additional VRMs to be included separately as vrms_final_extra

-- Further processing (possibly)
 - user type
 - durations

  - capacity after demand (for subsections)

** Final output and reporting ...
TODO:
create supply report that summarises by road and allowable restriction ...
create demand reports that summarise by:
 - road
 - restriction type

also output of raw data - vrms or restriction (counts)

-- for plans
 - supply - ensure that labels are correct and that all restriction types are showing ?? - TODO
 - photo locations
 -

-- Copy/rename photos with street names - and separate out those for suspensions
