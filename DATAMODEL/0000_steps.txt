-- For VRMs
* use scripts in 1000s

1. verify completeness of all beats
2. standardise VRM formats
3. remove duplicates and blanks
4. use "fuzzy" match
5. check "non-standard" VRMs
6. calculate demand
7. output VRMs and RiS

-- For Counts
* use scripts in 2000s

1. verify completeness of all beats
2. calculate demand
3. output Counts and RiS

--- Within spreadsheets, deal with:
 - Suspensions (ensure consistency across beats)
 - VRMs (check for consistency)

-- Reimport into

VRMs_Final
RestrictionsInSurveys_Final

-- Further processing (possibly)
 - user type
 - durations

  - capacity after demand (for subsections)


-- for plans
 - supply - ensure that labels are correct and that all restriction types are showing ?? - TODO
 - photo locations
 -
