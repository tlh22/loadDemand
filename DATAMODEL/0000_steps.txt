Main steps:

0. Load demand data
 - Use "load" project
 - copy photos and check for any that are missing. Amend and use .Demand/copy_photos_from_demand.bat

1. Check that everything is loaded correctly
 - visual check from "load" project
 - check counts in db (2000_verify_counts.sql). If using SurveyAreas, output and load into Pivot table
 - check for obvious errors (2001_check_counts.sql)

2. Prepare spreadsheet - both working and client (00_Projects/ParkingOccupancy_Templates)
 - Set up SYL control times (see TimePeriodsControlledDuringSurveyHours)
	 Create table - TimePeriodsControlledDuringSurveyHours
	 Add to project via Browser
	 Manually selected true/false 
 - Output supply (0001a_output_supply.sql)
 - Get surveys (0001b_output_surveys.sql) (and check dates of surveys - e.g., RBKC)
 - Add to working spreadsheet and create pivot
 - Copy to client 
 
3. Check supply and suspensions (from notes and photos)
 - Move demand details to RiS
     - for Counts; 2002_copy_count_details_to_ris.sql
 - Check RiS notes for changes in supply
	 - will need to ensure that all details are complete including RoadName
	 - if restrictions are added, ensure that they are added into demand tables - 
 - check VRMs for things like SY, SYL, DK, BINS, CONES, SKIP, etc

 - ensure suspensions are consistent (from notes and photos) - same location, details, number of spaces, etc


 - Add functions to calculate demand/stress, etc
     - for Counts; 2003a_add_capacity_and_demand.sql, 2003b_add_perceived_supply_and_stress.sql
     - for VRMs will also need user type and duration

4. Process
 - for VRMs, deal with matching including duplicates and other issues
     - standardise VRM formats
     - remove duplicates and blanks
     - use "fuzzy" match
     - check "non-standard" VRMs

5. Output
 - RiS - for Counts; 2004_output_RestrictionsInSurveys_Counts.sql. Use this in working spreadsheet. Update pivot table to show demand by road/restriction type
 - Photos - with street/section details - 0004_photos_with_details_from_RiS_demand.sql and 0005_photos_with_details_from_RiS_demand_Suspensions.sql

6. Mapping

 - Prepare supply plan and sort out labelling
 
 - run scripts:
     - set up "template" - 3001a_supply_view_parking_locations.sql
     - add locations - 3002_show_parking_locations_using_RiS.sql
	 - 3003a_prepare_stress_table_RoadName_from_db.sql
	 
 - Duplicate Supply layout and use for Locations
	 - Copy title details from earlier Locations layout
	 - Create Atlas. Use "Surveys" as "Coverage layer", filter to be "SurveyID" > 0, sort by "SurveyID"
	 - Add caveat on vehicle locations from earlier Locations layout
	 
 - Duplicate Locations layout and use for Stress

7. Data for client
 - Output RiS (and VRMs if appropriate)
 - 2004b_output_RestrictionsInSurveys_Counts_for_client.sql
 - for VRMs - 1055_Anonomise_VRMs.sql + 1060_output_vrms_final_for_report.sql
