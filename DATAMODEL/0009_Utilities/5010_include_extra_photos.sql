Process to import photos captured outside tablet into RiS 

Steps:
1. Import photos using Processing -> Import geotagged photos
2. Modify CRS using Processing -> Reproject layer with Target CRS as EPSG:27700 (OSGB36) & Save layer into database as <connection> demand."DemandPhotosImport"
3. Check that photos are in (approximately) the correct place

then use this script to add photos to RiS
