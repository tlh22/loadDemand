Process to import photos captured outside tablet 

Steps:
1. Import photos using Processing -> Import geotagged photos
2. Modify CRS using Processing -> Reproject layer with Target CRS as EPSG:27700 (OSGB36) & Save layer into database as <connection> demand."DemandPhotosImport"
3. Check that photos are in (approximately) the correct place

Then process with this script ...
