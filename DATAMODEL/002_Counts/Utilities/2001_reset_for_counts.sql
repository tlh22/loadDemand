 * Reset details for Counts - for reload
 
 --- Remember that you need to change over details in both RiS and Counts!
 
SELECT *
FROM "Counts" c, "RestrictionsInSurveys" RiS
WHERE c."GeometryID" = RiS."GeometryID"
AND RiS."SurveyID" = c."SurveyID"
AND c."SurveyID" = 101
AND RiS."Done" IS true
AND RiS."GeometryID" IN (
	SELECT "GeometryID" 
	FROM "Supply" s
	WHERE s."SurveyAreaID" = 5
	 )
;


SELECT *
FROM "Counts" c, "RestrictionsInSurveys" RiS
WHERE c."GeometryID" = RiS."GeometryID"
AND RiS."SurveyID" = c."SurveyID"
AND c."SurveyID" = 1010


In this case, details for 104 were entered into 101 for area 5 (id=5). So need to swap details around within Counts. RiS has already been dealt with ...

Step 1: Change SurveyID for all restrictions in target SurveyID
UPDATE "Counts" AS c
SET "SurveyID" = 1010
FROM "RestrictionsInSurveys" RiS
WHERE c."GeometryID" = RiS."GeometryID"
AND c."SurveyID" = RiS."SurveyID"
AND RiS."SurveyID" = 101
AND RiS."Done" IS true
AND RiS."GeometryID" IN (
	SELECT "GeometryID" 
	FROM "Supply" s
	WHERE s."SurveyAreaID" = 5
	 );

UPDATE "RestrictionsInSurveys" AS RiS
SET "SurveyID" = 1010
WHERE RiS."SurveyID" = 101
AND RiS."Done" IS true
AND RiS."GeometryID" IN (
	SELECT "GeometryID" 
	FROM "Supply" s
	WHERE s."SurveyAreaID" = 5
	 )
;

Step 2: Change SurveyID from correct
UPDATE "Counts" AS c1
SET "SurveyID" = 101
FROM "Counts" c2
WHERE c1."GeometryID" = c2."GeometryID"
AND c1."SurveyID" = 104
AND c2."SurveyID" = 1010;

UPDATE "RestrictionsInSurveys" AS RiS1
SET "SurveyID" = 101
FROM "RestrictionsInSurveys" RiS2
WHERE RiS1."GeometryID" = RiS2."GeometryID"
AND RiS1."SurveyID" = 104
AND RiS2."SurveyID" = 1010;


Step 3: Change SurveyID from 1010 to correct
UPDATE "Counts" AS c
SET "SurveyID" = 104
WHERE c."SurveyID" = 1010;

UPDATE "RestrictionsInSurveys" AS RiS
SET "SurveyID" = 104
WHERE RiS."SurveyID" = 1010;
